Opinionated browser extension that attempts to improve Trello's UX - in particular, the recent card redesign.

I don't trust third party extensions, and you shouldn't either. Clone this, inspect the code and install it locally. 

Chrome:

1. Naviate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
2. Toggle developer mode (top right)
3. Load unpacked extension (your checked out directory)
